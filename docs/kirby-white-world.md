# Kirby Air Riders white-world investigation

Program ID: `040077201BE50000`.

The changes fix three reproduced shader rejection mechanisms. They do not yet establish
which failure causes the white world, so an in-game run is still required. No
texture-format mapping is added.

## Evidence and fixes

The original `0bb0445671` log rejects a geometry program at instruction `0x9130`:
`08007950 ffff6ec0 03c3ffff 000fea00`. The engine's stage slot 4 is geometry,
not fragment. This is an unconditional `RET.REL.NODEC R8` whose relative base is zero.
The instruction cannot fall through into the exit handler. The same failure appears in
two programs in the subsequent `cb5b085c34` probe, at offsets `0x9130` and `0x9180`.
The log immediately records skipped draws into a 2048x1152 render target.

The geometry envelope validator previously required an unconditional EXIT immediately
before its handler, rejecting a valid return from a preceding subroutine. Allow the
verified return encoding, retain the lowerer's return-link checks, recognize the end
of the main body, and keep lowering through the handler after the subroutine returns.
Call-link tracking is enabled only for envelopes containing returns, so existing
return-free envelopes keep their previous behavior. Predicate, return-base, linkage,
handler-body, and branch-boundary checks remain in place.

The original log also rejects compute instruction
`5fdc7220 00000052 00410000 000fe200` at `0x36f0`. This is FMUL with destination
R220 and inputs R95/R82. R220 overlaps the lowerer's uniform-register mirrors, but
the guest-register preservation table did not include opcode `0x220`. Add its three
register operands to that table. A regression checks both operand remapping and the
translated result of multiplying 2 by 3 through the shadow register.

## Atomics behind unmapped pointers with a carried offset

In the `kirby-white3` run with render tracing, every traced draw (1,078 draws) is
configured. The only rejected GPU work is compute shader `0x1175573eed7481a4` (pipeline
`0xced45eff3d2d0513`, program `0x11c7811e00`). It fails with `Global atomic add with no
routable storage buffer`, and both of its dispatches at about 31 seconds are dropped.

The program has 70 `ATOMG.E.ADD` instructions. In the IR, 65 of them add an immediate
`0x1c` (and `+8`) to the 64-bit pointer at `c0[0x40]` in 32-bit halves. The carry
is computed as `low < pointer_low` and is added to the high word. The other 5 add a
thread-dependent 64-bit offset to the pointer at `c1[0x0]`; their carry is the add's
carry flag. Both pointers are classified unmapped when the pipeline is built.
[Lichii #47](https://github.com/zortos293/Lichii/pull/47) keeps the buffer only for a
pointer that is the atomic's bare address, so neither form matches. Offline, mapping
only `c0[0x40]` routes the 65; mapping only `c1[0x0]` routes the 5.

`CollectAtomicPointers` now also accepts a pointer when the high half of the atomic's
address sums the pointer's high word with a carry select whose condition reads the
pointer's low word. A 32-bit scalar added to a pointer carries nothing, so #47's case
of an atomic offset by `c0[0x40]` stays global. Upstream `nx2` still has the
throwing stub and no open or closed PR changes this routing.

The original log has 58 format-zero assertions, but the probe's white menus occur
without that assertion. Format zero is the hardware descriptor's INVALID encoding,
and component type 2 means UNORM; these fields do not identify an omitted valid
format. See NVIDIA's `NVC697_TEXHEAD_BL_COMPONENTS_SIZES_INVALID` in
[clc697tex.h](https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-doc/blob/master/classes/3d/clc697tex.h).
Full descriptor, handle, pool index, dimensions, address, and mapping traces have been
added rather than assigning a guessed format.

Upstream nx2, PR/issue searches, and relevant texture/shader diffs were checked.
Upstream does not contain the fork's `geometry_exit.h` or `register_pressure.h` helpers.
The X8Z24 fix from Eglantine #295 and the texture-header-offset fix are already present;
neither describes this format-zero entry. The subsequent upstream sync was merged
through origin/nx2, including #47, #48, #49 and #50.

## Ruled out: W scale factors and the graphics scale

The `f9dff5c28c` run builds every shader and still shows the white world. 83 of its 501 dumps
read `SR_WSCALEFACTOR_XY` and `SR_WSCALEFACTOR_Z` (S2UR 30 and 31): 82 graphics programs and
compute `0x130d607b00`. In the vertex programs the factors scale W for frustum tests that
choose an early EXIT, and lowering removes that rejection, so no IR reads the factors. None of
the 50 cached modules that contain the stub's `0x00ff0000` constant bitcasts it to a float;
each uses it only as a bit mask. The open upstream Eglantine #27 maps the factors to the
viewport clip-control guardband (256.0 or 1.0), but that would change no emitted module here.

`nx2:IGraphicsScaleController` command 1050 is `nn::oe::SetGraphicsScaleChangedNotificationEnabled(bool)`
(seedds/nxnative `dm/host/hle_oe.c`). It now has a handler instead of the auto-stub. Its reply
was already an empty success. Command 10 still returns 10, the handheld tier, which Donkey Kong
Bananza uses only as a quality tier.

## Verification

- Clang/Ninja shader build: all 199 Ampere and `[storage_buffer]` test cases pass
  (8,102,012 assertions). The new carry test fails without the routing change.
- The failing compute dump, compiled offline with no pointer mapped, emits 70
  `OpAtomicIAdd` on two storage buffers (`c0[0x40]`, `c1[0x0]`), with no global atomic
  left. The module passes `spirv-val --target-env vulkan1.2 --scalar-block-layout`.
- A sweep of the `kirby-white3` dumps plus the v48 cache (1,231 jobs) emits SPIR-V
  for all 1,038 modules, byte-identical to the output before the routing change.
- All three standalone shader-sweep suites passed, including a synthetic geometry
  CALL/RET/exit-handler program that emits a vertex and passes `spirv-val`.
- The Kirby v48 cache has 1,038 validated compiler cases and 94 cases missing
  captured context. Cached programs are already lowered; they cannot recover
  native programs rejected before caching.
- The four runtime translation units affected by diagnostics compile with clang.
  The generated GNU-only `-mtls-dialect=gnu2` flag was omitted for clang 18.
- All 48 additional geometry captures still fail at their original setup-liveness
  checks, not the RET/handler boundary: Raiders has 6 BRA, 2 predicate-logic and 2
  predicated EXIT cases; Duskbloods has 11 ALD, 16 texture, 9 uniform-add and 2
  floating-compare cases. No unrelated setup-liveness change is included.

## Next in-game capture

Set `EDEN_NX2_SHADER_DUMP` to an existing writable directory and
`EDEN_NX2_RENDER_TRACE=1`. Use log filter
`*:Info HW.GPU:Debug Render.Vulkan:Debug Shader:Debug`.

Besides native shader binaries, the dump directory now receives
`failed-compute-1175573eed7481a4-v49.env` if that compute pipeline fails and its
environment can be serialized. Replay it with:

```sh
build/shader-sweep/shader-sweep \
  --environment failed-compute-1175573eed7481a4-v49.env --cache-version 49 \
  --output shader.spv
```

Send the log, dump directory, and screenshots from both a menu and a race. Check whether
the compute rejection is gone and whether the 3D world returns with it.
